        Privacy Policy for <strong>LinkedIn Suggestions Blocker</strong>
      </h3>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 20, 2025</p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes the information practices for the LinkedIn Suggestions Blocker
        browser extension (&quot;the Extension&quot;). Please read this policy carefully to
        understand how your information is handled when you use the Extension.
      </p>
      <h4 id="what-is-personal-information-">What is personal information?</h4>
      <p>
        Personal information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
        person (&quot;data subject&quot;). Examples include names, email addresses, or identifiers
        like IP addresses.
      </p>
      <h4 id="information-linkedin-suggestions-blocker-collects">
        Information LinkedIn Suggestions Blocker collects
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Personal information</strong> The Extension does not collect, process, or store any
        personal information. No user data, including browsing activity, preferences, or
        interactions with LinkedIn, is transmitted to external servers or third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Anonymous information</strong> The Extension does not collect or transmit anonymous
        usage information. All functionality operates entirely on your local device and does not
        interact with external systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Server logs</strong> The Extension does not require server communication, so no
        server logs or related data are generated or stored.
      </p>
      <h4 id="analytics">Analytics</h4>
      <p>The Extension does not use any analytics or tracking tools.</p>
      <h4 id="how-linkedin-suggestions-blocker-processes-and-discloses-collected-information">
        How LinkedIn Suggestions Blocker processes and discloses collected information
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong>We don’t collect or store your information</strong> Because the Extension does not
        collect or transmit any data, there is no information to process, disclose, or sell to third
        parties.
      </p>
      <h4 id="data-security">Data security</h4>
      <p>
        While the Extension does not collect or store data, its open-source code is available for
        transparency and audit at:
        <a href="https://github.com/dommyrock/sug-purge">https://github.com/dommyrock/sug-purge</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ensures that users can verify the Extension’s behavior and confirm that no personal
        information is collected or processed.
      </p>
      <h4 id="your-rights">Your rights</h4>
      <p>
        Since the Extension does not collect or store personal information, there is no data to
        access, rectify, or erase. If you have any concerns or questions, you may contact us.
      </p>
      <h4 id="who-is-responsible-for-data-collection-and-processing-contacts-">
        Who is responsible for data collection and processing (contacts)?

      <h4 id="changes-and-updates-to-this-policy">Changes and updates to this policy</h4>
      <p>
        Suggestions Purge reserves the right to change this policy for any reason, and may make
        small, inconsequential changes to this policy with or without notice. Each time this policy
        is changed we will revise the &quot;Effective Date&quot; at the top of this page. Your
        continued use of the Suggestions Purge website or browser extension constitutes your
        agreement to this Privacy Policy and any revisions or updates.
